# Threading Removal Summary

## What was done:

### ✅ Moved to future/threading/:
- `thread_pool.h` - Thread pool interface
- `thread_pool.c` - Thread pool implementation  
- `multithreaded_core.c` - Multithreaded row processing logic

### ✅ Updated core module:
- Removed `ThreadPool *` from `CoreContext`
- Removed `#include "thread_pool.h"` from core.h
- Simplified `for_each_row_matching_filter()` to use single-threaded implementation only
- Removed multithreaded worker functions and structs
- Added placeholder field to keep `CoreContext` struct valid

### ✅ Core module now compiles successfully:
- No threading dependencies
- Clean, simple single-threaded implementation
- All threading code preserved in `future/` folder for later integration

## Future integration plan:

1. **Complete core DBMS features first**:
   - SQL parser improvements
   - Indexing system  
   - Transaction support
   - Comprehensive testing

2. **When ready for threading**:
   - Add `ThreadPool *thread_pool` back to `CoreContext`
   - Include `future/threading/thread_pool.h`
   - Integrate `multithreaded_core.c` logic
   - Add thread pool initialization in main application
   - Benchmark and optimize

## Benefits of this approach:

- ✅ **Simplified development** - focus on core functionality
- ✅ **Easier debugging** - no threading complexity
- ✅ **Code preserved** - threading logic not lost
- ✅ **Clean separation** - future features clearly organized
- ✅ **Portfolio ready** - working single-threaded DBMS

## Current status:

The core module compiles and works without threading. You can now focus on:
- Completing SQL functionality
- Adding more database features  
- Testing and optimization
- Documentation

Threading can be added later as an advanced optimization feature.
